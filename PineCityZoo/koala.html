                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
    <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to
        Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are
        the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's
        eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily
        recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The
        koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to
        chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their
        counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed</p>
    <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because
        this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20
        hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males
        communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions
        from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl
        into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas,
        known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are
        threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus. .</p>
<p>The word koala comes from the Dharug gula, meaning no water. It was at one time thought, since the animals were not
    observed to come down from trees often, that they were able to survive without drinking. The leaves of the
    eucalyptus tree have a high water content, so the koala does not need to drink often. But the notion that they do
    not need to drink water at all was shown to be a myth. Although the vowel 'u' was originally written in the
    English orthography as "oo" (in spellings such as coola or koolah), it was changed to "oa", possibly in error.
