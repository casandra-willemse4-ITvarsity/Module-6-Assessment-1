                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the
        okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described.[10] The elongation of the neck
        appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives
        suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down.[11] One
        early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago (mya),
        17–15 mya or 18–14.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. This animal was medium-sized, slender and
        antelope-like. Giraffokeryx appeared 15 mya on the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe,
        and had a longer neck and similar ossicones.[10] Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built
        giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.[11]</p>
    <p>Giraffids like Palaeotragus, Shansitherium and Samotherium appeared 14 mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia.
        These animals had bare ossicones and small cranial sinuses and were longer with broader skulls.[10][11] Paleotragus
        resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor.[10] Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before
        Giraffokeryx.[11] Samotherium was a particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage, as its
        cervical vertebrae were intermediate in length and structure between a modern giraffe and an okapi, and were more
        vertical than the okapi's.[12] Bohlinia, which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived 9–7 mya was likely a
        direct ancestor of the giraffe. Bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar
        ossicones and dentition.[10]</p>
<p>Bohlinia entered China and northern India in response to climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and,
    around 7 mya, entered Africa.[13] Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the
    African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1 mya
    in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene.[10] Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G.
    jumae;[14] others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate.[10] G. jumae was larger and more heavily built, while G.
    gracilis was smaller and more lightly built.[10] </p>
